    "# Multithreading\n",
    "Multithreading is a programming concept where multiple threads (lightweight subprocesses) run concurrently within a single process. It enables a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, improving efficiency and responsiveness, especially for tasks that involve I/O operations or multiple cores of a CPU."

It simplifies thread management by allowing you to create a pool of threads to which you can submit tasks. This is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks that involve operations like file reading, web scraping, or network requests."
