Machine learning finds patterns in data to make a suitable decision. 
Deep learning is a branch of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers. 
Today, problems such as computer vision, natural language processing, and driverless cars can be solved with deep learning.
To be able to do deep learning projects, I recommend you to learn machine learning first. 
Universities do not have a separate machine learning department. But fortunately, there are many free resources and training videos on the Internet.

Whether you are a student, an employee who wants to change careers, or someone who wants to use machine learning in your business, you can easily learn machine learning from open sources.

In this post, I’m going to cover the following topics:

What is machine learning?
Programming languages ​​for machine learning
Libraries for Python and R
Tools you should know for machine learning
Disciplines you need to learn
Algorithms for machine learning
Resources and YouTube channels for machine learning
Before getting started, please don’t forget to subscribe to my youtube channel where I create content about ai, data science, machine learning, and deep learning.

What is Machine Learning?
As you know, the amount of data produced has increased with the development of the internet and social media. 
If AI is today’s electricity, data is today’s oil. Companies such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon became huge companies because they evaluated the data they obtained. To use oil, you have to process it right? 
To extract meaningful information from data, you need to process it.

Machine learning is a subfield of AI that aims at automatically building models using data.

You may ask how machine learning came about. Let me explain this briefly. Previously, rules were entered into the machine, and output was produced for inputs according to these rules.
